It can be used to categorize transformer faults, based on the relative amounts of methane, acetylene and ethylene.\r\n\r\n## Basics\r\n\r\nThe classification can be done graphically, by printing the following chart on paper.\r\n\r\nThen use a ruler to draw a line for the relative amount of each of the three relevant gasses. All three lines should meet at one point.\r\n\r\nThe location of this point indicates the type of failure.\r\n\r\n![Duval Triangle Coordinates](img/duval-triangle-coordinates.png)\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nLet's do an example. From a lab measurement we get the following DGA values:\r\n\r\n- H2: 8 ppm\r\n- CH4: 1313 ppm\r\n- C2H2: 2908 ppm\r\n- C2H4: 616 ppm\r\n- C2H6: 420 ppm\r\n- CO: 450 ppm\r\n- CO2: 1069 ppm\r\n\r\nWe only need the values of C2H2, CH4 and C2H4. The other values are not used in the Duval triangle method.\r\n\r\n- The percentage of C2H2 is 2908/(2908 + 1313 + 616) = 0.601 = 60.1%.\r\n- The percentage of CH4 is 1313/(2908 + 1313 + 616) = 0.271 = 27.1%.\r\n- The percentage of C2H4 is 616/(2908 + 1313 + 616) = 0.127 = 12.7%.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding lines are drawn parallel to the labelling of the axes.\r\n\r\nThe point of intersection lies in the area called D1, meaning low energy discharge, or sparking.\r\n\r\n![Coordinates Example](img/duval-triangle-coordinates-example.png)\r\n\r\n## Failure Codes\r\n\r\nThe complete list of failures codes can be seen here:\r\n\r\n- PD: partial discharge\r\n- T1: thermal fault below 300 degrees celcius\r\n- T2: thermal fault between 300 and 700 degrees celcius\r\n- T3: thermal fault above 700 degrees celcius\r\n- D1: low energy discharge (sparking)\r\n- D2: high energy discharge (arcing)\r\n- DT: mixture of thermal and electrical faults\r\n\r\nNote how every possible combination of DGA values will result in a failure classification. There is no area designated as normal.\r\n\r\nThe duval triangle can only be used for fault classification, but not for fault detection. In other words: Before doing any of this, be sure that your transformer is actually faulty.\r\n\r\n# Algorithm\r\n\r\nThe code below implements the calculation of the classification as per the Duval Triangle One given an input with the three gases."},{"kind":2,"language":"e-lang","value":"domain DuvalTriangleOneAlgorithm\r\n\r\n"}]}
